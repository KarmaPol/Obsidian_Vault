You have a Google Cloud Platform account with access to both production and development projects. You need to create an automated process to list all compute instances in development and production projects on a daily basis. What should you do?

**A. Create two configurations using gcloud config. Write a script that sets configurations as active, individually. For each configuration, use gcloud compute instances list to get a list of compute resources.**

B. Create two configurations using gsutil config. Write a script that sets configurations as active, individually. For each configuration, use gsutil compute instances list to get a list of compute resources.

C. Go to Cloud Shell and export this information to Cloud Storage on a daily basis.

D. Go to GCP Console and export this information to Cloud SQL on a daily basis.
​

정답 : A

gcloud compute instances list는 프로젝트의 모든 GCE 인스턴스를 표시함

You have a large 5-TB AVRO file stored in a Cloud Storage bucket. Your analysts are proficient only in SQL and need access to the data stored in this file. You want to find a cost-effective way to complete their request as soon as possible. What should you do?

A. Load data in Cloud Datastore and run a SQL query against it.

B. Create a BigQuery table and load data in BigQuery. Run a SQL query on this table and drop this table after you complete your request.

**C. Create external tables in BigQuery that point to Cloud Storage buckets and run a SQL query on these external tables to complete your request.**

D. Create a Hadoop cluster and copy the AVRO file to NDFS by compressing it. Load the file in a hive table and provide access to your analysts so that they can run SQL queries.

정답 : C

Cloud Storage 버킷을 가리키는 BigQuery에서 외부 테이블 만들고 SQL 쿼리 요청하는 방법

Cloud Datastore는 SQL 실행하기 좋은 선택지가 아니므로 A는 오답

이미 버킷에 있는 내용을 BigQuery에 데이터 로드하는 것은 비용이 많이 들어서 B는 오답

Hadoop에 파일을 압축하여 NDFS에 복사 후 하이브 테이블에 파일 로드 후 SQL 쿼리를 날리는 방법은 너무 복잡한 방법이라서 오답

B. Create a route called allow-udp-636 and set the next hop to be the VM instance running the LDAP server.

C. Add a network tag of your choice to the instance. Create a firewall rule to allow ingress on UDP port 636 for that network tag.

D. Add a network tag of your choice to the instance running the LDAP server. Create a firewall rule to allow egress on UDP port 636 for that network tag.

정답 : C

LDAP 서버가 CE에 배포되었고 UDP 포트 636에 대한 인바운드 트래픽 허용이 필요한 상황

CE 인스턴스에 대한 ingress UDP 트래픽을 허용하는 것이 해결 방법

C. Select Regional Storage. Add a bucket lifecycle rule that archives data after 30 days to Nearline Storage.

D. Select Regional Storage. Add a bucket lifecycle rule that archives data after 30 days to Coldline Storage.

정답 : D

사이트는 C가 정답이라고 하지만 토론을 보면 D가 압도적

1년에 한번 액세스하기 때문에 Nearline인 B, C는 오답

데이터를 한 geographic location에서 가져오므로 A는 오답

You are building a product on top of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). You have a single GKE cluster. For each of your customers, a Pod is running in that cluster, and your customers can run arbitrary code inside their Pod. You want to maximize the isolation between your customers' Pods. What should you do?

A. Use Binary Authorization and whitelist only the container images used by your customers' Pods.

B. Use the Container Analysis API to detect vulnerabilities in the containers used by your customers' Pods.

**C. Create a GKE node pool with a sandbox type configured to gvisor. Add the parameter runtimeClassName: gvisor to the specification of your customers' Pods.**

D. Use the cos_containerd image for your GKE nodes. Add a nodeSelector with the value cloud.google.com/gke-os-distribution: cos_containerd to the specification of your customers' Pods.

​
정답 : C

**gvisor**로 구성된 샌드박스 유형으로 GKE 노드 풀을 만들어 최대한 격리

정답 : A

사이트는 D가 답이라고 하지만 토론은 A가 압도적

D도 가능하지만 매번 프로젝트 구성을 초기화하도록 강제하여 GCP 권장 사항이 아님

Cloud SDK에서 gcloud init 또는 gcloud config set를 사용하여 속성을 설정할 수 있음

여러 프로젝트 또는 승인 계정으로 작업 시 gcloud config configuration 생성을 사용하여

여러 configuration을 설정하고 적절히 전환할 수 있음
