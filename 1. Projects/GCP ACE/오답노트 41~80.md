You recently deployed a new version of an application to App Engine and then discovered a bug in the release. You need to immediately revert to the prior version of the application. What should you do?

A. Run gcloud app restore.

B. On the App Engine page of the GCP Console, select the application that needs to be reverted and click Revert.

**C. On the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console, route 100% of the traffic to the previous version.**

​You deployed an App Engine application using gcloud app deploy, but it did not deploy to the intended project. You want to find out why this happened and where the application deployed. What should you do?

**A. Check the app.yaml file for your application and check project settings.**

B. Check the web-application.xml file for your application and check project settings.

C. Go to Deployment Manager and review settings for deployment of applications.

D. Go to Cloud Shell and run gcloud config list to review the Google Cloud configuration used for deployment.

정답 : A

APP.YAML 파일에서 버전 및 URL을 포함한 앱의 모든 런타임 컨피그를 지정함

YAML 파일에 프로젝트 지정이 되었는지 확인이 필요함

You have production and test workloads that you want to deploy on Compute Engine. Production VMs need to be in a different subnet than the test VMs. All the

VMs must be able to reach each other over Internal IP without creating additional routes. You need to set up VPC and the 2 subnets. Which configuration meets these requirements?

**A. Create a single custom VPC with 2 subnets. Create each subnet in a different region and with a different CIDR range.**

B. Create a single custom VPC with 2 subnets. Create each subnet in the same region and with the same CIDR range.

C. Create 2 custom VPCs, each with a single subnet. Create each subnet in a different region and with a different CIDR range.

D. Create 2 custom VPCs, each with a single subnet. Create each subnet in the same region and with the same CIDR range.
​

정답 : A

동일한 지역에서 같은 CIDR IP 범위를 가질 수 없기 때문에 B는 답이 아님

서브넷의 기본 및 보조 범위는 할당 된 범위, 동일한 네트워크에 있는

다른 서브넷의 기본 또는 보조 범위와 겹칠 수 없음.

또한, VPC는 본질적으로 글로벌이며, 서브넷은 지역적이지만 전 세계적으로 연결됨

그래서 서로 다른 서브넷에 대해 1개의 VPC와 서로 다른 CIDR을 만드는 것이 목적으로 충분함

You are given a project with a single virtual private cloud (VPC) and a single subnetwork in the us-central1 region. There is a Compute Engine instance hosting an application in this subnetwork. You need to deploy a new instance in the same project in the europe-west1 region. This new instance needs access to the application. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?

**A. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.**

B. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Expose the application with an internal load balancer. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the load balancer's address as the endpoint.

C. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Use Cloud VPN to connect the two subnetworks. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.

D. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Peer the 2 VPCs. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.

정답 : A

B가 아닌 이유는 IP가 변경되고 연결이 끊어지는 이유로 인스턴스 1이 죽는 것으로 보이며

내부 로드 밸런서를 추가하는 것은 필요 없는 비용이 추가됨

C는 Cloud VPN 연결을 위해 주소를 예약해야 돼서 예약된 IP와 사용된 리소스에 대한 비용 지불이 필요하기 때문

You have a web application deployed as a managed instance group. You have a new version of the application to gradually deploy. Your web application is currently receiving live web traffic. You want to ensure that the available capacity does not decrease during the deployment. What should you do?

A. Perform a rolling-action start-update with maxSurge set to 0 and maxUnavailable set to 1.

**B. Perform a rolling-action start-update with maxSurge set to 1 and maxUnavailable set to 0.**

C. Create a new managed instance group with an updated instance template. Add the group to the backend service for the load balancer. When all instances in the new managed instance group are healthy, delete the old managed instance group.

D. Create a new instance template with the new application version. Update the existing managed instance group with the new instance template. Delete the instances in the managed instance group to allow the managed instance group to recreate the instance using the new instance template.

정답 : B

maxSurge = 업데이트 프로세스 중에 만들 수 있는 최대 추가 인스턴스 수

maxUnavailable = 업데이트 프로세스 중에 사용할 수 없는 최대 인스턴스 수

전역 용량이 그대로 유지되도록 해야 하기 때문에 maxUnavailable을 0으로 설정해야 함

반면 새 인스턴스를 만들 수 있는지 확인이 필요해서 maxSurge를 1로 설정함

C는 비싸고 설정하기 어렵고, D는 글로벌 용량을 그대로 유지하지 않아서 오답

You have an application running in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with cluster autoscaling enabled. The application exposes a TCP endpoint. There are several replicas of this application. You have a Compute Engine instance in the same region, but in another Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), called gce-network, that has no overlapping IP ranges with the first VPC. This instance needs to connect to the application on GKE. You want to minimize effort. What should you do?

A. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Set the service's externalTrafficPolicy to Cluster. 3. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.

B. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type NodePort that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Create a Compute Engine instance called proxy with 2 network interfaces, one in each VPC. 3. Use iptables on this instance to forward traffic from gce-network to the GKE nodes. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of proxy in gce-network as endpoint.

**C. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add an annotation to this service: cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: Internal 3. Peer the two VPCs together. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.**

D. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add a Cloud Armor Security Policy to the load balancer that whitelists the internal IPs of the MIG's instances. 3. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.
