## Processes and Threads
- Threads share resources of a process
	- Change made by one thread affect other thread
- Processes don't share resources
### Thread Properties
- Exists within a process and uses the process resource
- dies if the parent process dies
- has its own independent flow
- "lightweight"
## pthread
- UNIX 표준
- 프로세스에 비해 10~ 50배 싼 비용
### Thread Creation
- specify NULL to use default attributes
### Thread Termination
**Several Ways**
- The thread returns from its starting routine
- The thread makes a calll to the pthread_exit subroutine
- The threads canceled by another thread via the pthread_cancel routine
- The entire process is terminated due to making a call to either the exec(), exit()
- If main() finishes first -> without calling pthread_exit explicitly itself

```c
void pthread_exit(void *ptr);
```
- typically, **pthread_exit()** routine is called to quit the thread
- If main() finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with pthread_exit(),
  the other threads will continue to execute
  Otherwise, they will be automatically terminated when main() finishes
- Termination status optionally specified that is stored as a void pointer for any thread that may join the calling thread
### Thread Cancellation
- One Thread can request that another exit with **pthread_cancel()**
## Joining
```c
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
```
- join() subroutine blocks the calling thread untill the specified thread terminates
- value_ptr을 통해
